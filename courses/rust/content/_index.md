## Welcome to Rust Basics in 30 Days!

Rust is a systems programming language that provides memory safety, concurrency, and performance without a garbage collector. This course is designed to take you from a curious developer to a confident Rustacean.

### Why Learn Rust?

Rust has been voted the "most loved language" in Stack Overflow's developer survey for years. It combines the performance of C/C++ with the safety of modern high-level languages.

- **Memory Safety**: Rust's compiler prevents common bugs like null pointer dereferences and data races.
- **Zero-cost Abstractions**: Use high-level features without a performance penalty.
- **Fearless Concurrency**: Build multi-threaded applications without the typical headaches.
- **Modern Tooling**: Cargo (Rust's package manager) is widely considered one of the best in the industry.

### Curriculum at a Glance

- **Week 1: Rust Fundamentals** - Syntax, types, functions, and the "Rust way" of thinking.
- **Week 2: The Core: Ownership** - Ownership, Borrowing, Slices, and Structs.
- **Week 3: Power Tools** - Enums, Match, Error Handling, and Modules.
- **Week 4: Advanced Concepts** - Traits, Generics, and Lifetimes.
- **Week 5: Final Project** - Build a high-performance CLI tool.
