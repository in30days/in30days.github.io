    {
      "question": "How many different types of loop keywords does Go have?",
      "options": [
        "Three: for, while, and do-while",
        "Two: for and while",
        "One: only for",
        "Four: for, while, do, and repeat"
      ],
      "answer": "One: only for",
      "explanation": "Go only has one looping construct, the 'for' loop, which can be used in various forms to replicate while or infinite loops."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following creates an infinite loop in Go?",
      "options": [
        "for (true) { }",
        "while true { }",
        "for { }",
        "loop { }"
      ],
      "answer": "for { }",
      "explanation": "A 'for' loop without any condition, initialization, or post statement is an infinite loop in Go."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the 'continue' keyword do in a loop?",
      "options": [
        "Immediately exits the loop",
        "Restarts the entire loop from the beginning",
        "Skips the rest of the current iteration and goes to the next one",
        "Pauses the loop execution"
      ],
      "answer": "Skips the rest of the current iteration and goes to the next one",
      "explanation": "The 'continue' statement skips the remaining code in the current loop body and proceeds to the next iteration (evaluating the post statement and condition)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you iterate over a collection (like a string or slice) while getting both index and value?",
      "options": [
        "Using the 'each' keyword",
        "Using the 'range' keyword",
        "Using a standard for loop with len()",
        "Using the 'map' function"
      ],
      "answer": "Using the 'range' keyword",
      "explanation": "The 'range' keyword allows you to iterate over elements in various data structures, returning the index and the value at each step."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can you break out of an outer loop from within a nested inner loop?",
      "options": [
        "Use 'break break'",
        "Use 'exit'",
        "Use a label with the 'break' statement",
        "It's not possible in Go"
      ],
      "answer": "Use a label with the 'break' statement",
      "explanation": "Go supports labels which can be used with break or continue statements to specify which loop the operation should apply to in nested scenarios."
