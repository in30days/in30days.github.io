## Welcome to Go Fundamentals!

This course will take you from complete beginner to confident Go programmer. Go (also known as Golang) is a modern, statically-typed language designed at Google for building reliable, efficient software at scale.

### Why Learn Go?

Go has become one of the most sought-after programming languages because it combines:

- **Simplicity** - Clean syntax that's easy to read and write
- **Performance** - Compiled to native machine code for speed
- **Concurrency** - Built-in support for concurrent programming
- **Reliability** - Strong typing and excellent tooling
- **Scalability** - Powers infrastructure at Google, Docker, Kubernetes, and more

### What You'll Learn

- **Modules 1-7: Go Fundamentals** - Setup, variables, types, operators, control flow, functions
- **Modules 8-14: Data Structures** - Arrays, slices, maps, structs, pointers, methods
- **Modules 15-21: Interfaces & Errors** - Interface design, error handling, type assertions
- **Modules 22-28: Packages & Concurrency** - Modules, standard library, goroutines, channels
- **Modules 29-30: Final Project** - Build a complete CLI application

### How It Works

1. **Read** the module content with interactive examples
2. **Practice** by running code in the Go Playground or locally
3. **Complete** the quiz (80% required to pass)
4. **Progress** to the next module!
