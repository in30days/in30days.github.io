    {
      "question": "Which of the following is TRUE about Go's if statement?",
      "options": [
        "Parentheses are required around the condition",
        "Braces {} are optional for single-line bodies",
        "Parentheses are not required around the condition",
        "The condition must be an integer"
      ],
      "answer": "Parentheses are not required around the condition",
      "explanation": "Go does not require parentheses around the condition in an if statement, but braces {} are always required."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the scope of a variable declared in an 'if' initialization statement like 'if y := 20; y > 15'?",
      "options": [
        "The entire function where the if statement is defined",
        "Only the if block and its corresponding else/else if blocks",
        "Only the if block, but not the else block",
        "The entire package"
      ],
      "answer": "Only the if block and its corresponding else/else if blocks",
      "explanation": "Variables declared in the if initialization statement are scoped to the if statement and any associated else if or else blocks."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Go's switch statement handle case fall-through?",
      "options": [
        "Cases fall through by default, similar to C or JavaScript",
        "You must use the 'break' keyword to prevent fall-through",
        "Cases do not fall through by default; each case ends automatically",
        "Fall-through is not supported in Go"
      ],
      "answer": "Cases do not fall through by default; each case ends automatically",
      "explanation": "In Go, switch cases do not fall through by default. You don't need 'break' statements. If you explicitly want fall-through, you must use the 'fallthrough' keyword."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which keyword is used to explicitly fall through to the next case in a switch statement?",
      "options": [
        "continue",
        "next",
        "fallthrough",
        "goto"
      ],
      "answer": "fallthrough",
      "explanation": "The 'fallthrough' keyword is used to unconditionally transfer control to the first statement of the next case clause."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Go have a ternary conditional operator (condition ? val1 : val2)?",
      "options": [
        "Yes, it works exactly like in C/Java",
        "No, Go requires using an if-else statement instead",
        "Yes, but it uses a different syntax",
        "Only for constant expressions"
      ],
      "answer": "No, Go requires using an if-else statement instead",
      "explanation": "Go does not have a ternary operator. The designers of Go chose to omit it to favor the more explicit and readable if-else construct."
