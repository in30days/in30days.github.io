      "question": "Which of the following are true about Go? (Select all that apply)",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "Go was developed at Google", "correct": true },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Go is an interpreted language like Python", "correct": false },

        { "id": "e", "text": "Go requires a virtual machine to run", "correct": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "Go was developed at Google, compiles directly to native machine code (no VM needed), and has built-in concurrency support through goroutines and channels. It's a compiled language, not interpreted."

      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "This is an executable program", "correct": true },
        { "id": "b", "text": "This is a library package", "correct": false },
