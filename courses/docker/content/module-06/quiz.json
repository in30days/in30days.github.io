      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "CMD is for scripts, ENTRYPOINT is for binaries", "correct": false },
        { "id": "b", "text": "ENTRYPOINT sets the executable, CMD sets default arguments that can be overridden", "correct": true },

      "explanation": "ENTRYPOINT defines the command that will run when the container starts. CMD provides default arguments for that entrypoint which the user can easily override at runtime."

      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "To make the build faster by leveraging layer caching", "correct": true },

      ],
      "explanation": "Docker caches layers. By copying only the dependency files (like package.json) first and running install, Docker only needs to re-run the installation if the dependencies change, rather than every time you edit a line of code."
