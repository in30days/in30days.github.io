## Welcome to Docker Fundamentals!

Docker has revolutionized how we build, ship, and run applications. By abstracting away the underlying infrastructure, Docker ensures that your code runs exactly the same way in production as it does on your local machine.

This course is designed to take you from the historical "why" of containers to mastering multi-container orchestration with Docker Compose.

### What You'll Learn

- **Section 1: The Container Revolution** - History of isolation, chroot, jails, and the birth of Docker.
- **Section 2: Core Docker Mechanics** - Images, containers, layers, and the Dockerfile instruction set.
- **Section 3: Data & Networking** - Persistence via volumes and how containers communicate.
- **Section 4: Orchestration with Compose** - Defining complex environments in a single YAML file.
- **Section 5: Advanced Fundamentals** - Multi-stage builds and security hardening.
- **Section 6: Capstone Project** - Containerizing a complete full-stack environment.

### How It Works

1. **Read** the module content with detailed technical breakdowns.
2. **Practice** with multiple hands-on exercises in every module.
3. **Complete** the quiz (80% required to pass) to unlock the next module.
