      "question": "Why is it important to have a separate 'save_tasks' function?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "It keeps the main loop clean and reusable", "correct": true },
        { "id": "b", "text": "Python requires it for file safety", "correct": false },
        { "id": "c", "text": "It prevents duplication of code every time a task is added or deleted", "correct": true }
      ],
      "explanation": "Separating logic into functions (Modularization) makes your code easier to maintain and prevents repeating the same logic."

      "question": "Which mode is best for 'save_tasks' if you are overwriting the whole list with the new state?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "r", "correct": false },
        { "id": "b", "text": "w", "correct": true },
        { "id": "c", "text": "a", "correct": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "When saving a full list state, 'w' (write) mode is used to clear the old file content and start fresh with the current list."

      "question": "What is the purpose of the 'if __name__ == \"__main__\":' line?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "a", "text": "It checks if the computer is on", "correct": false },
        { "id": "b", "text": "It ensures the script only runs if executed directly, not if imported as a module", "correct": true },
        { "id": "c", "text": "It creates a new user profile", "correct": false }
      ],
      "explanation": "This is a common Python pattern that allows you to write code that can be both imported as a library and run as a standalone script."
