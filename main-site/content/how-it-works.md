# Master Any Technology

This learning platform is designed for consistency, retention, and mastery. Here is how we help you learn complex technologies in a structured way.

## 1. Modular Structure
Each course is divided into bite-sized lessons. By committing to focused learning sessions, you build a habit that leads to long-term retention.

## 2. Mastery-Based Progression
You cannot simply "skip ahead." To unlock the next module, you must complete the current lesson's quiz with a score of **80% or higher**. This ensures you've grasped the core concepts before moving to more advanced topics.

## 3. Learning Paths
A **Learning Path** is a curated sequence of courses. While one course might teach you the basics of Python, a Path will take you through Advanced Python and Web Development, providing a complete roadmap to professional competence.

## 4. Progress Tracking & Cloud Sync
Your progress is saved locally in your browser first. You can also:
- **Cloud Sync:** Link your Google account to sync your progress across multiple devices.
- **Export/Import:** Download your progress as a JSON file at any time.

## 5. Community-Driven
Every lesson features a discussion section powered by GitHub Discussions. Ask questions, share your code, and learn from others in the same cohort.

## 6. Got feedback?
You can share your feedback by opening an issue in the repository https://github.com/learnerscommunity/issues.
